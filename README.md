# Freyja-Cryptic

Detect cryptic variant circulation in wastewater sequencing data. Beginning with ![Freyja covariants](https://andersen-lab.github.io/Freyja/src/usage/covariants.html) outputs, this tool will query each mutation cluster occurring on the same read pair to determine if the cluster has been previously detected in clinical sequencing.
